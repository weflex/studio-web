* Personal Information and Preferences
** Basic Information
*** Avatar
User's avatar image. We can get user's avatar image when he connects
his Wechat account via OAuth or when he [[Upload Avatar][uploads one]].
**** Upload Avatar
*** Name
User's name. It comes with user's account as he filled in [[file:../login-and-signup/Send Invitation Request.png][the sign up
form]] when he enrolled into WeFlex Studio.
** Contacts and Accounts
*** Phone
User's phone. It also comes with user's account, see [[file:../login-and-signup/Send Invitation Request.png][the sign up form]].
**** Verifying Phone
We allow user to update his phone number as he may switch to another
number or he may lost it. Since phone is a key we used to identify
users, we need to verify his new phone number.

By default, the =Get Passcode= button on the right side of phone
number is disabled and greyed out, as well as the =Passcode= text
field below it. When user tries to modify his phone number, he click
on the =Phone= input and thus activates the =Get Passcode= button, as
well as the =Passcode= field. If user leaves =Phone= without any
modification, then, again, =Get Passcode= button gets greyed out. This
UI behavior applies also on other pages where phone verification are
required.
*** Wechat
User's Wechat Account. When user have not Wechat account connected, it
shows up a [[QR Code]] for user to scan, so that he can authorize WeFlex
Studio to use his public data from Wechat.

** Information Completeness
On the right side of all the information, there's a progress bar
showing how many information about himself user have filled in. Each
information have a score.

| wechat |    50 | 30 when =avatar= exists |
| email  |    20 |                         |

According to the score table above, user have starts from a ~30%~
(~10%~ from =name= and ~20%~ from =phone=) completeness and he could
earn a higher and higher score by connecting more accounts and
uploading more information.
