* The Problem
Users should abled, and free as their will to log on to WeFlex Studio
to start using it. Thus a user may:
1. Login with an existing account. This should be the most usual case;
2. Create a new account in an existing organization;
or he/she's a completely new user, to
3. Create a new account and studio organization from scratch.

These three cases represent three types of users with each our
knowledge of them degrades. The less we know about a user, the more
the information we need to ask him for.
* The Solution
** Login
The first screen a user would see right after he opened WeFlex Studio,
is the [[Login Screen][Login Screen]].

On the [[Login Screen][Login Screen]] user could choose to login with SMS verification
or with Wechat OAuth. Note that SMS verification is the default login
method.

If this user belongs to an organization but he hasn't got an account
for himself, he could tap on the guide below Sign Up button to [[Search Studio][try
search for the studio he works at]].
** Search Studio
At this screen user type in keywords to search for the studio he works
at so that we can help him setup a connection with that studio and
[[Request For Invitation][send a request to studio's manager]].

Unfortunately, the studio he works at may not using WeFlex Studio at
this moment, and he couldn't find any match. At these cases, [[Search Studio Not Found Screen][a text
hint below the search box]] will guide user to [[Create a Studio][create a account from
scratch]].

** Request For Invitation
If the studio this user works at is using WeFlex Studio but he doesn't
have a account, he will need his admin's permission to have one. Thus
he will need to send admin a /Request for Invitation/ on [[Request Invitation Screen][request form]].
His admin will receive a SMS message about his request.

** Create a Studio
If this user is a completely new user, then we will ask him to signup
and create a studio from scratch.
